#1. Create a guessing game program using input, a while loop and if statements
#2. You must use the random library, so put import random at the top of your program
#3. Ask the user for their name, and keep track of the number of guesses they have Take
#4. If they take more than 6 tries to guess the number, end the game and tell them the number
