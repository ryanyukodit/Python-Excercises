
#1. Create a program that has two integer variables with values of your choosing
#2. Print them to the screen
#3. Then create four variables called addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
#4. addition = number 1 + number 2
#5. subtraction = number 1 - number 2
#6. multiplication = number 1 - number 2
#7. division = number 1 / number 2
#8. Finally, print out the value of each variable using the print function

#Example (print("multiplication =", multiplication)
