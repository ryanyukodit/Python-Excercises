#1. Create a program that will create a string called word 1 that equals "backyard"
#2. Then create another string called word2 that equals "frontdesk"
#3. Then we want to use string concatenation to create a variable called word3 
# that equals frontyard
#4. Then create a string called word4 that equals backdesk
#5. Then create a string called word5 that equals frontback
#6. Finally, print out all your results

word1 = "backyard"
word2 = "frontdesk"
word3 = word2[0:5] + word1[4:8]
word4 = word1[0:4] + word2[5:9]
word5 = word2[0:5] + word1[0:4]
print("Word 1: ", word1)
print("word 2: ", word2)
print("Word 3: ", word3)
print("Word 4: ", word4)
print("Word 5: ", word5)
