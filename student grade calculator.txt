#1. Lets create a program to find the average of test grades
#2. Create 5 variables called test1, test2, test3, test4, and test5 and assign them values 1-100
#3. Next we are going to create a data structure called a list, lets call it scores
#4. Load all the tests into the list called scores
#5. Now create a variable called total to get the sum of the scores, using the sum utility on the list
#6. Now create a variable called length to get the total number of scores in the list.
# Use the len utility on the list
#7. Now the grade will equal total / length
#8. Finally, print out your grade
